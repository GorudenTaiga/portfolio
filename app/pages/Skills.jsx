It was part of my school lessons ‚Äî I learned it while preparing for LSP (kind of like a certification test). It was my first time playing around with a real web framework, and honestly‚Ä¶ it was fun!' },
  { icon: <FaPhp />, title: 'PHP', level: 85, date: '2021-12', description: 'My journey with PHP started even earlier ‚Äî when I was in 10th grade. That was literally my first step into the world of web programming. At first, I was super clueless, but PHP kinda felt comfortable to use. Simple, clean, and pretty beginner-friendly for me at that time.' },
  { icon: <SiJavascript />, title: 'JavaScript', level: 80, date: '2021-06', description: 'Of course, when I started learning web dev, one of the very first languages I met was JavaScript. And wow‚Ä¶ This language is crazy. You can literally build anything with JS. It‚Äôs flexible, powerful, and super fun to play around with. Big respect for JavaScript!' },
  { icon: <FaReact />, title: 'React.js', level: 70, date: '2024-08', description: 'My adventure with React.js actually started out of necessity. I needed to build a portfolio website that looked cool, responsive, and interactive ‚Äî and everyone kept saying ‚ÄúJust use React bro, it‚Äôs perfect for that.‚Äù So I gave it a shot... And yeah, React did not disappoint at all. Totally worth learning for front-end development.' },
  { icon: <SiUnrealengine />, title: 'Unreal Engine', level: 96, date: '2022-06', description: 'Fun fact, before I even learned programming seriously at school, I actually tried Unreal Engine 4 when I was in 8th grade. But I was just messing around back then ‚Äî didn‚Äôt really focus on it. I only started taking Unreal Engine seriously when I was in 11th grade‚Ä¶ and went straight to Unreal Engine 5 because why not?' },
  { icon: <FaUnity />, title: 'Unity', level: 78, date: '2024-05', description: 'I found Unity when I joined an Indonesian Game Developer community. At that time, I wanted to try other game engines besides Unreal Engine. And I was surprised how lightweight Unity was ‚Äî even my old laptop could still handle it! That‚Äôs why I decided to also dive into Unity.' },
  { icon: <SiCplusplus />, title: 'C++', level: 80, date: '2021-10', description: 'While most people started their programming journey with Python (the safe choice), I went the hard way ‚Äî I learned C++ first because it was part of my school lessons. And honestly? No regrets. Learning C++ really taught me a lot about how programming works under the hood.' },
  { icon: <TbBrandCSharp />, title: 'C#', level: 85, date: '2022-08', description: 'Then I met C# (C-Sharp) during my 11th grade at school. Compared to C++, this language felt like a breath of fresh air. The syntax is clean, easy to read, and very beginner-friendly ‚Äî especially if you already survived C++ before' }
